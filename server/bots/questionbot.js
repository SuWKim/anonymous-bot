// QUESTIONBOT
////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Purpose: Takes questions that are sent via direct message to it and reposts
// them in another channel. Currently used to anonymize questions asked for other
// members or leadership in a company/team to answer without knowledge of who
// asked said questions.

let token = Meteor.settings.private.slack.questionbotSlackAPIToken,
    // The RTM (real-time messaging) URL for connecting to Slack via the token

    autoReconnect = true,
    // ??

    // Connects to Slack via an external package

    // TO DO - Join this channel if not a member of this channel

var messageId = 1;

// Function for when the connection to Slack opens
slack.on('open', Meteor.bindEnvironment(function() {
  // Logs to the console
  console.log("questionbot started");

// Function for when a message is sent to a channel that this bot belongs to
slack.on('message',  Meteor.bindEnvironment(function(message) {

      // Gets the channel ID from the name of the channel the bot wants to post to
  let channelId = Modules.server.getChannelIdFromName(token, channelToPostTo),

      postChannel = slack.getChannelGroupOrDMByID(channelId),

  // Checks to see if the message the channel was sent from was a private channel

    messageChannel.send("Your question/suggestion has been successfully posted to the <#" + channelId +  "|" + postChannel.name + "> channel.");

// When there's an error
